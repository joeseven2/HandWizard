HandWizard is a spell casting tool that uses hand gestures to cast spells. Built with [handtrack.js](https://github.com/victordibia/handtrack.js) and inspired by this [codepen](https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/pen/wGyNzL), it allows users to control the magic with simple hand movements.

## Getting Started
To use the tool, simply start the video by clicking the "Toggle Video Control" button, and make hand gestures in front of the webcam. The program will detect and display the current hand gesture on the screen, and will also track the gestures made over time. Once the correct spell gesture is performed, the background will change to indicate a spell has been cast.

The program has four predefined spells that users can cast:

- Open, Closed, Open, Closed
- Point, Closed, Point, Closed

## Features
User-friendly webpage that displays a live video feed of your hand gestures.
Easy tracking of hand gestures through the use of handtrack.js
Four predefined spell gestures that can be cast by performing the corresponding hand gestures.
Background change to indicate a spell has been successfully cast.

## Requirements
- A webcam
- A modern web browser that supports webRTC.

## Note
The current version of the program is a prototype, and more features and spells will may added in the future updates.
